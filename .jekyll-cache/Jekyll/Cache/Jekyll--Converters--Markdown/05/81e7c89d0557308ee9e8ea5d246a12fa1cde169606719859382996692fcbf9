I"Å<p>Currently, I am a second-year M.S. student at ECE department, UCLA. My major interests include <a href="https://github.com/quanpr/decouple-roi-pooling">computer vision</a>, model compression, adversarial machine learning, and <a href="https://github.com/cjlin1/simpleNN">optimization</a>, which may be found at my <a href="https://github.com/quanpr">Github</a>.  <!-- I joined NESL at UCLA to work with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/people/1/) on Adversarial Machine Learning. I am also working on Newton's method for Convolutional Neural Networks with [Prof. Chih-Jen Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/). --></p>
