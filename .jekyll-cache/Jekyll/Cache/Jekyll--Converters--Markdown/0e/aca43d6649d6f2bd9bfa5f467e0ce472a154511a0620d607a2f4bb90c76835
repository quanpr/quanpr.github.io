<p>I am an enthusiast of large-scale machine learning, optimization, and their applications. I have broad interests ranging from <a href="https://github.com/quanpr/decouple-roi-pooling">computer vision</a>, model compression, adversarial machine learning to <a href="https://github.com/cjlin1/simpleNN">optimization</a>, which may be found at my <a href="https://github.com/quanpr">Github</a>. I am currently a second-year master student at ECE department, UCLA. I obtained my B.Sc Degree in Electronic Engineering, First Class, from the Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong. Since my early year of research, I have been grateful to work with so many outstanding researchers.</p>
