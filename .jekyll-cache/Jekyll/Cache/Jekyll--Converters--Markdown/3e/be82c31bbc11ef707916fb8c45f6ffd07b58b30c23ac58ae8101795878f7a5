I"ç<p>My interests ranging from <a href="https://github.com/quanpr/decouple-roi-pooling">computer vision</a>, model compression, adversarial machine learning to <a href="https://github.com/cjlin1/simpleNN">optimization</a>, which may be found at my <a href="https://github.com/quanpr">Github</a>. Currently, I am a second-year M.S. student at ECE department, UCLA. I joined NESL at UCLA and work with <a href="http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/people/1/">Prof. Mani Srivastava</a> on Adversarial Machine Learning. I am also working on Newton‚Äôs method for Convolutional Neural Networks with <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/">Prof. Chih-Jen Lin</a>.</p>
