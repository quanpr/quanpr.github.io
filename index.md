Currently, I am a second-year M.S. student at ECE department, UCLA. My major interests include [computer vision](https://github.com/quanpr/decouple-roi-pooling), model compression, adversarial machine learning, and [optimization](https://github.com/cjlin1/simpleNN). Implementation and technical reports can be found at my [Github](https://github.com/quanpr).  <!-- I joined NESL at UCLA to work with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/people/1/) on Adversarial Machine Learning. I am also working on Newton's method for Convolutional Neural Networks with [Prof. Chih-Jen Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/). -->
